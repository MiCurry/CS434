## Project Proposal

Our team has chosen to tackle the Quora Question Pairs problem. At our
first glance at the data we plan on using a Naive Bayes classifier on the data
to determine if they are similar choices or not.

At the first look at the data we are sure there will have to be data cleaning of
some kind. We assume that we will have to pick out keywords that help us best
characterize the data, but as of now, we are not sure how that is. Possibly
removing words that are not necessary, like articles of speech (the, and, etc.).

We are thinking that the more two questions have similar words the percentage of
their class being linked would be greater. We think that using the Naive Bayes,
or another form of Naive Bayes, will help us make predictions.

Our plan is to implement the Naive Bayes classifier, train and it and see if we
can fine tune the data before we train and test it to get better results.

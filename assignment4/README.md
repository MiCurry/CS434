# Running the Code
The code runs a python 2 so it should be simple to run and requires pip
to make sure you have the packages we use installed.
1. First install the requirements using pip
'''
pip install -r requirements
'''
2. Run our implementation by running the following (pass the -v or --verbose flag to produce verbose output)
'''
python logRegress.py -v 2 # This will determine the learning rate!
'''

If you have any questions or problems, let us know. Thanks.
